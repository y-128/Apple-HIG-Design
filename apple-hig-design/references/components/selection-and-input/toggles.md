# Toggles

A toggle lets people choose between a pair of opposing states, like on and off, using a different appearance to indicate each state.

## Core guidance

A toggle can have various styles, such as switch and checkbox, and different platforms use these styles in different ways — see Platform considerations below. In addition to toggles, all platforms also support buttons that behave like toggles by using a different appearance for each state; for developer guidance, see `ToggleStyle`.

### Best practices

**Use a toggle to help people choose between two opposing values that affect the state of content or a view.** A toggle always lets people manage the state of something, so if you need to support other types of actions — such as choosing from a list of items — use a different component, like a pop-up button.

**Clearly identify the setting, view, or content the toggle affects.** In general, the surrounding context provides enough information for people to understand what they're turning on or off. In some cases, often in macOS apps, you can also supply a label to describe the state the toggle controls. If you use a button that behaves like a toggle, you generally use an interface icon that communicates its purpose, and you update its appearance — typically by changing the background — based on the current state.

**Make sure the visual differences in a toggle's state are obvious.** For example, you might add or remove a color fill, show or hide the background shape, or change the inner details you display — like a checkmark or dot — to show that a toggle is on or off. Avoid relying solely on different colors to communicate state, because not everyone can perceive the differences.

## Platform considerations

No additional considerations for tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS.

### iOS, iPadOS

**Use the switch toggle style only in a list row.** You don't need to supply a label in this situation because the content in the row provides the context for the state the switch controls.

**Change the default color of a switch only if necessary.** The default green color tends to work well in most cases, but you might want to use your app's accent color instead. Be sure to use a color that provides enough contrast with the uncolored appearance to be perceptible.

> *Image caption:* Standard switch color, compared with a custom switch color.

**Outside of a list, use a button that behaves like a toggle, not a switch.** For example, the Phone app uses a toggle on the filter button to let users filter their recent calls. The app adds a blue highlight to indicate when the toggle is active, and removes it when the toggle is inactive.

> *Image caption:* The Phone app uses a toggle to switch between all recent calls and various filter options. When someone chooses a filter, the toggle appears with a custom background drawn behind the symbol. When someone returns to the main Recents view, the toggle appears without anything behind the symbol.

**Avoid supplying a label that explains the button's purpose.** The interface icon you create — combined with the alternative background appearances you supply — help people understand what the button does. For developer guidance, see `changesSelectionAsPrimaryAction`.

### macOS

In addition to the switch toggle style, macOS supports the checkbox style and also defines radio buttons that can provide similar behaviors.

**Use switches, checkboxes, and radio buttons in the window body, not the window frame.** In particular, avoid using these components in a toolbar or status bar.

#### Switches

**Prefer a switch for settings that you want to emphasize.** A switch has more visual weight than a checkbox, so it looks better when it controls more functionality than a checkbox typically does. For example, you might use a switch to let people turn on or off a group of settings, instead of just one setting. For developer guidance, see `switch`.

**Within a grouped form, consider using a mini switch to control the setting in a single row.** The height of a mini switch is similar to the height of buttons and other controls, resulting in rows that have a consistent height. If you need to present a hierarchy of settings within a grouped form, you can use a regular switch for the primary setting and mini switches for the subordinate settings. For developer guidance, see `GroupedFormStyle` and `ControlSize`.

**In general, don't replace a checkbox with a switch.** If you're already using a checkbox in your interface, it's probably best to keep using it.

#### Checkboxes

A checkbox is a small, square button that's empty when the button is off, contains a checkmark when the button is on, and can contain a dash when the button's state is mixed. Typically, a checkbox includes a title on its trailing side. In an editable checklist, a checkbox can appear without a title or any additional content.

**Use a checkbox instead of a switch if you need to present a hierarchy of settings.** The visual style of checkboxes helps them align well and communicate grouping. By using alignment — generally along the leading edge of the checkboxes — and indentation, you can show dependencies, such as when the state of a checkbox governs the state of subordinate checkboxes.

**Consider using radio buttons if you need to present a set of more than two mutually exclusive options.** When people need to choose from options in addition to just "on" or "off," using multiple radio buttons can help you clarify each option with a unique label.

**Consider using a label to introduce a group of checkboxes if their relationship isn't clear.** Describe the set of options, and align the label's baseline with the first checkbox in the group.

**Accurately reflect a checkbox's state in its appearance.** A checkbox's state can be on, off, or mixed. If you use a checkbox to globally turn on and off multiple subordinate checkboxes, show a mixed state when the subordinate checkboxes have different states. For example, you might need to present a text-style setting that turns all styles on or off, but also lets people choose a subset of individual style settings like bold, italic, or underline. For developer guidance, see `allowsMixedState`.

#### Radio buttons

A radio button is a small, circular button followed by a label. Typically displayed in groups of two to five, radio buttons present a set of mutually exclusive choices.

A radio button's state is either selected (a filled circle) or deselected (an empty circle). Although a radio button can also display a mixed state (indicated by a dash), this state is rarely useful because you can communicate multiple states by using additional radio buttons. If you need to show that a setting or item has a mixed state, consider using a checkbox instead.

> *Image caption:* A radio button in the Selected and Deselected states.

**Prefer a set of radio buttons to present mutually exclusive options.** If you need to let people choose multiple options in a set, use checkboxes instead.

**Avoid listing too many radio buttons in a set.** A long list of radio buttons takes up a lot of space in the interface and can be overwhelming. If you need to present more than about five options, consider using a component like a pop-up button instead.

**To present a single setting that can be on or off, prefer a checkbox.** Although a single radio button can also turn something on or off, the presence or absence of the checkmark in a checkbox can make the current state easier to understand at a glance. In rare cases where a single checkbox doesn't clearly communicate the opposing states, you can use a pair of radio buttons, each with a label that specifies the state it controls.

**Use consistent spacing when you display radio buttons horizontally.** Measure the space needed to accommodate the longest button label, and use that measurement consistently.

## Web translation *(derived — not from Apple)*

Apple's HIG contains no web guidance. The mappings below apply the same principles to the web; they are inference, not Apple policy.

**Switch vs. checkbox is a semantic distinction the web already has an answer for, just not through separate elements.** Apple treats "switch" and "checkbox" as two visual styles of the same underlying model — a boolean choice — and reserves switch for settings that take effect immediately (an iOS list row, a macOS setting you want to emphasize) and checkbox for choices reviewed as part of a set (macOS hierarchies, mixed state). HTML has one native control for a boolean choice, the checkbox input; there is no separate, universally supported switch input type in the stable standard. A `switch` attribute on a checkbox input has begun shipping, first in Safari, that restyles it as a track-and-thumb control while keeping checkbox semantics underneath — support isn't yet universal, so treat it as a progressive enhancement layered on a plain checkbox, not something to depend on.

**The real fork is in the accessibility role, not the markup element.** A plain checkbox exposes a "checked / not checked" state to assistive technology. ARIA's switch role exposes an "on / off" state instead, through the same underlying checked-state mechanism — it's defined as a specialization of checkbox, not a separate widget. This is exactly the line Apple draws with its own guidance: apply the switch role (or the native `switch` attribute where it's supported, which applies the role for you) when the control's own state is the thing being changed, matching Apple's iOS switch usage; leave a plain checkbox with no role override when the control participates in a group or hierarchy of settings, matching Apple's macOS checkbox guidance for indentation and dependency. Applying the switch role to something that's actually a member of a checklist misleads screen-reader users about what will happen when they activate it.

**A custom-built switch loses accessibility in the same three places every custom control does.** Build it from a styled `<div>` with a click handler and it has no keyboard operability (no Space/Enter activation without manually wiring focusability and key handlers), no accessible name-to-control association unless you replicate a native label's behavior by hand, and no state exposure to assistive technology unless you maintain the checked state in sync with the visual state on every interaction, including keyboard-driven ones. The lowest-effort correct implementation is a real button or checkbox input with the switch role layered on top and styled to look like a track and thumb — never a purely visual, non-focusable element.

**Apple's "don't rely solely on color" maps to forced-colors and high-contrast preferences.** A switch whose on/off states differ only by fill color disappears under a forced-colors or high-contrast display mode, which strips background colors down to a small system palette. The web-native fix mirrors Apple's own recommendation almost exactly: encode the state in the thumb's position and in a shape change — a checkmark, a filled versus outlined track — so meaning survives even when color is neutralized.

**The mixed/indeterminate checkbox state exists on the web, but only through script.** Apple's mixed checkbox state (a dash, used when subordinate checkboxes disagree) maps to the indeterminate property available on checkbox form elements — there's no HTML attribute for it, it must be set with JavaScript, and it's a purely visual and assistive-technology-exposed state that doesn't submit its own value with the form. This matches Apple's own framing of "mixed" as a display state layered on top of an otherwise binary control, not a third value.

**Radio buttons need the least translation of anything on this page.** Radio inputs grouped by a shared name already give mutually exclusive selection, arrow-key navigation within the group, and correct assistive-technology announcement, all natively — Apple's radio-button guidance (groups of two to five, consistent spacing, prefer over a lone toggle when there are more than two states) applies to the web with no accessibility loss, as long as you use the native element rather than rebuilding a radio group with a hand-rolled roving-tabindex pattern, which is real, well-documented complexity the native element sidesteps entirely.
