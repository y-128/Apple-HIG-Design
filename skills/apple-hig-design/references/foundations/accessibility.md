# Accessibility

Accessible user interfaces empower everyone to have a great experience with your app or game.

## Core guidance

When you design for accessibility, you reach a larger audience and create a more inclusive experience. An accessible interface allows people to experience your app or game regardless of their capabilities or how they use their devices. Accessibility makes information and interactions available to everyone. An accessible interface is:

- **Intuitive.** Your interface uses familiar and consistent interactions that make tasks straightforward to perform.
- **Perceivable.** Your interface doesn't rely on any single method to convey information. People can access and interact with your content, whether they use sight, hearing, speech, or touch.
- **Adaptable.** Your interface adapts to how people want to use their device, whether by supporting system accessibility features or letting people personalize settings.

As you design your app, audit the accessibility of your interface. Use Accessibility Inspector to highlight accessibility issues with your interface and to understand how your app represents itself to people using system accessibility features. You can also communicate how accessible your app is on the App Store using Accessibility Nutrition Labels.

### Vision

The people who use your interface may be blind, color blind, or have low vision or light sensitivity. They may also be in situations where lighting conditions and screen brightness affect their ability to interact with your interface.

**Support larger text sizes.** Make sure people can adjust the size of your text or icons to make them more legible, visible, and comfortable to read. Ideally, give people the option to enlarge text by at least **200 percent** (or **140 percent** in watchOS apps). Your interface can support font size enlargement either through custom UI, or by adopting Dynamic Type — a systemwide setting that lets people adjust the size of text for comfort and legibility.

**Use recommended defaults for custom type sizes.** Each platform has different default and minimum sizes for system-defined type styles to promote readability. If you're using custom type styles, follow the recommended defaults.

| Platform | Default size | Minimum size |
|---|---|---|
| iOS, iPadOS | 17 pt | 11 pt |
| macOS | 13 pt | 10 pt |
| tvOS | 29 pt | 23 pt |
| visionOS | 17 pt | 12 pt |
| watchOS | 16 pt | 12 pt |

Bear in mind that font weight can also impact how easy text is to read. If you're using a custom font with a thin weight, aim for larger than the recommended sizes to increase legibility.

> *Image caption:* Thicker weights are easier to read for smaller font sizes.
> *Image caption:* Consider increasing the font size when using a thin weight.

**Strive to meet color contrast minimum standards.** To ensure all information in your app is legible, it's important that there's enough contrast between foreground text and icons and background colors. Two popular standards of measure for color contrast are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA). Use standard contrast calculators to ensure your UI meets acceptable levels. Accessibility Inspector uses the following values from WCAG Level AA as guidance in determining whether your app's colors have an acceptable contrast.

| Text size | Text weight | Minimum contrast ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 17 pts | All | 4.5:1 |
| 18 pts | All | 3:1 |
| All | Bold | 3:1 |

If your app doesn't provide this minimum contrast by default, ensure it at least provides a higher contrast color scheme when the system setting Increase Contrast is turned on. If your app supports Dark Mode, make sure to check the minimum contrast in both light and dark appearances.

> *Image caption:* A button with insufficient color contrast, and a button with sufficient color contrast.

**Prefer system-defined colors.** These colors have their own accessible variants that automatically adapt when people adjust their color preferences, such as enabling Increase Contrast or toggling between the light and dark appearances.

> *Image caption:* The systemRed default color in iOS, and the systemRed accessible color in iOS.

**Convey information with more than color alone.** Some people have trouble differentiating between certain colors and shades. For example, people who are color blind may have particular difficulty with pairings such as red-green and blue-orange. Offer visual indicators, like distinct shapes or icons, in addition to color to help people perceive differences in function and changes in state. Consider allowing people to customize color schemes such as chart colors or game characters so they can personalize your interface in a way that's comfortable for them.

> *Image caption:* For someone with red-green color blindness, indicators that rely on color alone might appear the same; both visual indicators and color help differentiate between indicators.

**Describe your app's interface and content for VoiceOver.** VoiceOver is a screen reader that lets people experience your app's interface without needing to see the screen.

### Hearing

The people who use your interface may be deaf or hard of hearing. They may also be in noisy or public environments.

**Support text-based ways to enjoy audio and video.** It's important that dialogue and crucial information about your app or game isn't communicated through audio alone. Depending on the context, give people different text-based ways to experience their media, and allow people to customize the visual presentation of that text:

- **Captions** give people the textual equivalent of audible information in video or audio-only content. Captions are great for scenarios like game cutscenes and video clips where text synchronizes live with the media.
- **Subtitles** allow people to read live onscreen dialogue in their preferred language. Subtitles are great for TV shows and movies.
- **Audio descriptions** are interspersed between natural pauses in the main audio of a video and supply spoken narration of important information that's presented only visually.
- **Transcripts** provide a complete textual description of a video, covering both audible and visual information. Transcripts are great for longer-form media like podcasts and audiobooks where people may want to review content as a whole or highlight the transcript as media is playing.

**Use haptics in addition to audio cues.** If your interface conveys information through audio cues — such as a success chime, error sound, or game feedback — consider pairing that sound with matching haptics for people who can't perceive the audio or have their audio turned off. In iOS and iPadOS, you can also use Music Haptics and Audio graphs to let people experience music and infographics through vibration and texture.

**Augment audio cues with visual cues.** This is especially important for games and spatial apps where important content might be taking place off screen. When using audio to guide people towards a specific action, also add in visual indicators that point to where you want people to interact.

### Mobility

Ensure your interface offers a comfortable experience for people with limited dexterity or mobility.

**Offer sufficiently sized controls.** Controls that are too small are hard for many people to interact with and select. Strive to meet the recommended minimum control size for each platform to ensure controls and menus are comfortable for all when tapping and clicking.

| Platform | Default control size | Minimum control size |
|---|---|---|
| iOS, iPadOS | 44x44 pt | 28x28 pt |
| macOS | 28x28 pt | 20x20 pt |
| tvOS | 66x66 pt | 56x56 pt |
| visionOS | 60x60 pt | 28x28 pt |
| watchOS | 44x44 pt | 28x28 pt |

**Consider spacing between controls as important as size.** Include enough padding between elements to reduce the chance that someone taps the wrong control. In general, it works well to add about **12 points** of padding around elements that include a bezel. For elements without a bezel, about **24 points** of padding works well around the element's visible edges.

> *Image caption:* Elements with insufficient padding, and elements with sufficient padding.

**Support simple gestures for common interactions.** For many people, with or without disabilities, complex gestures can be challenging. For interactions people do frequently in your app or game, use the simplest gesture possible — avoid custom multifinger and multihand gestures — so repetitive actions are both comfortable and easy to remember.

**Offer alternatives to gestures.** Make sure your UI's core functionality is accessible through more than one type of physical interaction. Gestures can be less comfortable for people who have limited dexterity, so offer onscreen ways to achieve the same outcome. For example, if you use a swipe gesture to dismiss a view, also make a button available so people can tap or use an assistive device.

> *Image caption:* Edit and tap to delete, and swipe to delete.

**Let people use Voice Control to give guidance and enter information verbally.** With Voice Control, people can interact with their devices entirely by speaking commands. They can perform gestures, interact with screen elements, dictate and edit text, and more. To ensure a smooth experience, label interface elements appropriately.

**Integrate with Siri and Shortcuts to let people perform tasks using voice alone.** When your app supports Siri and Shortcuts, people can automate the important and repetitive tasks they perform regularly. They can initiate these tasks from Siri, the Action button on their iPhone or Apple Watch, and shortcuts on their Home Screen or in Control Center.

**Support mobility-related assistive technologies.** Features like VoiceOver, AssistiveTouch, Full Keyboard Access, Pointer Control, and Switch Control offer alternative ways for people with low mobility to interact with their devices. Conduct testing and verify that your app or game supports these technologies, and that your interface elements are appropriately labeled to ensure a great experience.

### Speech

Apple's accessibility features help people with speech disabilities and people who prefer text-based interactions to communicate effectively using their devices.

**Let people use the keyboard alone to navigate and interact with your app.** People can turn on Full Keyboard Access to navigate apps using their physical keyboard. The system also defines accessibility keyboard shortcuts and a wide range of other keyboard shortcuts that many people use all the time. Avoid overriding system-defined keyboard shortcuts and evaluate your app to ensure it works well with Full Keyboard Access.

**Support Switch Control.** Switch Control is an assistive technology that lets people control their devices through separate hardware, game controllers, or sounds such as a click or a pop. People can perform actions like selecting, tapping, typing, and drawing when your app or game supports the ability to navigate using Switch Control.

### Cognitive

When you minimize complexity in your app or game, all people benefit.

**Keep actions simple and intuitive.** Ensure that people can navigate your interface using easy-to-remember and consistent interactions. Prefer system gestures and behaviors people are already familiar with over creating custom gestures people must learn and retain.

**Minimize use of time-boxed interface elements.** Views and controls that auto-dismiss on a timer can be problematic for people who need longer to process information, and for people who use assistive technologies that require more time to traverse the interface. Prefer dismissing views with an explicit action.

**Consider offering difficulty accommodations in games.** Everyone has their own way of playing and enjoying games. To support a variety of cognitive abilities, consider adding the ability to customize the difficulty level of your game, such as offering options for people to reduce the criteria for successfully completing a level, adjust reaction time, or enable control assistance.

**Let people control audio and video playback.** Avoid autoplaying audio and video content without also providing controls to start and stop it. Make sure these controls are discoverable and easy to act upon, and consider global settings that let people opt out of auto-playing all audio and video.

**Allow people to opt out of flashing lights in video playback.** People might want to avoid bright, frequent flashes of light in the media they consume. A Dim Flashing Lights setting allows the system to calculate, mitigate, and inform people about flashing lights in a piece of media. If your app supports video playback, ensure that it responds appropriately to the Dim Flashing Lights setting.

**Be cautious with fast-moving and blinking animations.** When you use these effects in excess, it can be distracting, cause dizziness, and in some cases even result in epileptic episodes. People who are prone to these effects can turn on the Reduce Motion accessibility setting. When this setting is active, ensure your app or game responds by reducing automatic and repetitive animations, including zooming, scaling, and peripheral motion. Other best practices for reducing motion include:

- Tightening animation springs to reduce bounce effects
- Tracking animations directly with people's gestures
- Avoiding animating depth changes in z-axis layers
- Replacing transitions in x-, y-, and z-axes with fades to avoid motion
- Avoiding animating into and out of blurs

**Optimize your app's UI for Assistive Access.** Assistive Access is an accessibility feature in iOS and iPadOS that allows people with cognitive disabilities to use a streamlined version of your app. Assistive Access sets a default layout and control presentation for apps that reduces cognitive load, such as the layout of the Camera app. To optimize your app for this mode, use the following guidelines when Assistive Access is turned on:

- Identify the core functionality of your app and consider removing noncritical workflows and UI elements.
- Break up multistep workflows so people can focus on a single interaction per screen.
- Always ask for confirmation twice whenever people perform an action that's difficult to recover from, such as deleting a file.

## Platform considerations

No additional considerations for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or watchOS.

### visionOS

visionOS offers a variety of accessibility features people can use to interact with their surroundings in ways that are comfortable and work best for them, including head and hand Pointer Control, and a Zoom feature.

**Prioritize comfort.** The immersive nature of visionOS means that interfaces, animations, and interactions have a greater chance of causing motion sickness, and visual and ergonomic discomfort for people. To ensure the most comfortable experience, consider these tips:

- Keep interface elements within a person's field of view. Prefer horizontal layouts to vertical ones that might cause neck strain, and avoid demanding the viewer's attention in different locations in quick succession.
- Reduce the speed and intensity of animated objects, particularly in someone's peripheral vision.
- Be gentle with camera and video motion, and avoid situations where someone may feel like the world around them is moving without their control.
- Avoid anchoring content to the wearer's head, which may make them feel stuck and confined, and also prevent them from using assistive technologies like Pointer Control.
- Minimize the need for large and repetitive gestures, as these can become tiresome and may be difficult depending on a person's surroundings.

## Web translation *(derived — not from Apple)*

Apple's HIG contains no web guidance. The mappings below apply the same principles to the web; they are inference, not Apple policy.

**Support larger text sizes → respect user zoom and root font size.** Dynamic Type's 200 percent target has a direct web analogue: WCAG 2.1 already requires text to reflect up to 200 percent zoom without loss of content or functionality. Never disable pinch-zoom or set `user-scalable=no`, and size type in `rem` so browser zoom and OS-level text-size preferences both work.

**Color contrast minimums → this is the one place Apple's numbers already are web standards.** The 4.5:1 and 3:1 ratios Accessibility Inspector checks against are lifted directly from WCAG 2.1 Level AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text ≥18pt/14pt-bold and for UI component boundaries). There is no translation needed here — run the same contrast checkers Apple recommends against your web CSS. Where Apple diverges, it is by also supporting APCA, a newer perceptual model; APCA is a reasonable web contrast target as well, but WCAG AA remains the legally referenced baseline in most jurisdictions.

**Increase Contrast → `prefers-contrast: more`.** Apple's system setting maps to a real, standardized CSS media feature. The web equivalent is directly implementable, not approximate.

**Convey information with more than color alone → this is WCAG 1.4.1 verbatim.** Icons, text labels, patterns, or underlines alongside color-coded meaning are required, not optional, under the same web accessibility standards Apple's own contrast tooling borrows from.

**Sufficiently sized controls → the 44×44 pt default matches WCAG 2.5.5 / 2.5.8.** WCAG's Target Size guidance recommends a 44×44 CSS-pixel minimum for pointer targets (24×24 as an AA-level minimum with spacing exceptions). Apple's platform-default table and the web's target-size criteria were arrived at independently but land on the same number, which is a useful sanity check when sizing tap targets in responsive layouts.

**Captions, subtitles, audio descriptions, transcripts → native web features exist for all four.** The HTML `track` element supports `kind="captions"`, `kind="subtitles"`, and `kind="descriptions"` directly; a transcript is simply accompanying text content. Unlike some Apple guidance, this is not an inference — the web has purpose-built mechanisms that map one-to-one to Apple's four categories.

**Keyboard-alone navigation and Switch Control → focus order, `:focus-visible`, and switch-accessible interaction patterns.** The web equivalent of Full Keyboard Access is ensuring every interactive element is reachable and operable via `Tab`/`Enter`/`Space` in a logical DOM order, with a visible focus indicator (`:focus-visible`) rather than a suppressed outline. Switch Control's scanning interaction model maps to the same requirement: nothing should require a gesture or continuous pointer motion that a single-switch or head-tracking input device cannot replicate.

**Reduce Motion → `prefers-reduced-motion`.** Like Increase Contrast, this is a direct, standardized mapping. Apple's specific remediations — tightening springs, avoiding z-axis depth changes, replacing transitions with fades — are a reasonable checklist for what to change when the media query matches, since CSS has no equivalent of "reduce bounce" as a single toggle.

**Assistive Access's "reduce and simplify" model → has no clean web analogue.** Apple ships an OS-level alternate UI mode that app developers opt into. The web has no equivalent system-level mechanism; a "simplified mode" on the web must be built and maintained by the site itself (a separate simplified layout, a reader mode, or progressive disclosure), and there is no browser feature that automatically strips an interface down to core functionality. Treat Apple's underlying principles — single interaction per screen, double confirmation for destructive actions — as good general UX advice rather than something with a platform-provided implementation.

## Do / Don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Let people enlarge text at least 200% (140% on watchOS) | Rely on a fixed, non-adjustable text size |
| Meet the WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large/bold) | Ship a color scheme that only "looks fine" without checking contrast |
| Provide a higher-contrast variant for Increase Contrast | Assume your default contrast is good enough in every mode |
| Pair color with shapes, icons, or text to convey meaning | Use color as the only signal for status or difference |
| Size controls to at least the platform minimum, with generous padding | Pack small, tightly spaced controls that are easy to mis-tap |
| Offer an onscreen alternative to every gesture | Make a gesture the only way to reach core functionality |
| Let people dismiss views with an explicit action | Auto-dismiss important content on a timer |
| Respond to Reduce Motion by cutting automatic, repetitive animation | Ignore Reduce Motion and keep bouncing, zooming, or blurring |
| Respond to Dim Flashing Lights in video playback | Let bright, frequent flashes play unmitigated |
| Support Full Keyboard Access and Switch Control navigation | Override system-defined keyboard shortcuts |
