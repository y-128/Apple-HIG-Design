# Menus

A menu reveals its options when people interact with it, making it a space-efficient way to present commands in your app or game.

## Core guidance

Menus are ubiquitous in apps and games, so most people already know how to use them. Whether you use system-provided components or custom ones, people expect menus to behave in familiar ways. For example, people understand that opening a menu reveals one or more menu items, each of which represents a command, option, or state that affects the current selection or context. The guidance for labeling and organizing menu items applies to all types of menus in all experiences.

> **Note (Apple):** Several system-provided components also include menus that support specific use cases. For example, a pop-up button or pull-down button can reveal a menu of options directly related to its action; a context menu lets people access a small number of frequently used actions relevant to their current view or task; and in macOS and iPadOS, menu bar menus contain all the commands people can perform in the app or game.

### Labels

A menu item's label describes what it does and may include a symbol if it helps to clarify meaning. In an app, a menu item can also display the associated keyboard command, if there is one; in a game, a menu item rarely displays a keyboard command because a game typically needs to handle input from a wider range of devices and may offer game-specific mappings for various keys.

> **Note (Apple):** Depending on menu layout, an iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS app can display a few unlabeled menu items that use only symbols or icons to identify them. For guidance, see visionOS and iOS, iPadOS.

**For each menu item, write a label that clearly and succinctly describes it.** In general, label a menu item that initiates an action using a verb or verb phrase that describes the action, such as View, Close, or Select. For guidance labeling menu items that show and hide something in the interface or show the currently selected state of something, see Toggled items. As with all the copy you write, let your app's or game's communication style guide the tone of the menu-item labels you create.

**To be consistent with platform experiences, use title-style capitalization.** Although a game might have a different writing style, generally prefer using title-style capitalization, which capitalizes every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and short prepositions, and capitalizes the last word in the label, regardless of the part of speech. For complete guidance on this style of capitalization in English, see title-style capitalization.

**Remove articles like a, an, and the from menu-item labels to save space.** In English, articles always lengthen labels, but rarely enhance understanding. For example, changing a menu-item label from View Settings to View the Settings doesn't provide additional clarification.

**Show people when a menu item is unavailable.** An unavailable menu item often appears dimmed and doesn't respond to interactions. If all of a menu's items are unavailable, the menu itself needs to remain available so people can open it and learn about the commands it contains.

**Append an ellipsis to a menu item's label when the action requires more information before it can complete.** The ellipsis character (…) signals that people need to input information or make additional choices, typically within another view.

### Icons

**Represent common actions consistently.** The system provides standard icons to represent common actions like Share, Print, and Search. Using standard icons makes your app easier to use and more familiar. For a list of icons that represent common actions, see Standard icons.

**Use menu item icons sparingly and with purpose.** Icons allow people to find menu items more quickly, and help clarify what selecting an item does. Use an icon to highlight the most common actions and key features of your app, file system locations, connected devices, visual concepts like rotating or flipping an image, and user-generated content like folders and documents. Don't display an icon if you can't find one that clearly represents the menu item.

**Apply a uniform visual treatment across menu items in the same group.** For visual consistency and balance, provide icons for all menu items in a group, or none of them.

### Organization

Organizing menu items in ways that reflect how people use your app or game can make your experience feel straightforward and easy to use.

**Prefer listing important or frequently used menu items first.** People tend to start scanning a menu from the top, so listing high-priority items first often means that people can find what they want without reading the entire menu.

**Consider grouping logically related items.** For example, grouping editing commands like Copy, Cut, and Paste or camera commands like Look Up, Look Down, and Look Left can help people remember where to find them. To help people visually distinguish such groups, use a separator. Depending on the platform and type of menu, a separator appears between groups of items as a horizontal line or a short gap in the menu's background appearance.

**Prefer keeping all logically related commands in the same group, even if the commands don't all have the same importance.** For example, people generally use Paste and Match Style much less often than they use Paste, but they expect to find both commands in the same group that contains more frequently used editing commands like Copy and Cut.

**Be mindful of menu length.** People need more time and attention to read a long menu, which means they may miss the command they want. If a menu is too long, consider dividing it into separate menus. Alternatively, you might be able to use a submenu to shorten the list, such as listing difficulty levels in a submenu of a New Game menu item. The exception is when a menu contains user-defined or dynamically generated content, like the History and Bookmarks menus in Safari. People expect such a menu to accommodate all the items they add to it, so a long menu is fine, and scrolling is acceptable.

### Submenus

Sometimes, a menu item can reveal a set of closely related items in a subordinate list called a submenu. A menu item indicates the presence of a submenu by displaying a symbol — like a chevron — after its label. Submenus are functionally identical to menus, aside from their hierarchical positioning.

**Use submenus sparingly.** Each submenu adds complexity to the interface and hides the items it contains. You might consider creating a submenu when a term appears in more than two menu items in the same group. For example, instead of offering separate menu items for Sort by Date, Sort by Score, and Sort by Time, a game could present a menu item that uses a submenu to list the sorting options Date, Score, and Time. It generally works well to use the repeated term — in this case, Sort by — in the menu item's label to help people predict the contents of the submenu.

**Limit the depth and length of submenus.** It can be difficult for people to reveal multiple levels of hierarchical submenus, so it's generally best to restrict them to a single level. Also, **if a submenu contains more than about five items**, consider creating a new menu.

**Make sure a submenu remains available even when its nested menu items are unavailable.** A submenu item — like all menu items — needs to let people open it and learn about the commands it contains.

**Prefer using a submenu to indenting menu items.** Using indentation is inconsistent with the system and doesn't clearly express the relationships between the menu items.

### Toggled items

Menu items often represent attributes or objects that people can turn on or off. If you want to avoid listing a separate menu item for each state, it can be efficient to create a single, toggled menu item that communicates the current state and lets people change it.

**Consider using a changeable label that describes an item's current state.** For example, instead of listing two menu items like Show Map and Hide Map, you could include one menu item whose label changes from Show Map to Hide Map, depending on whether the map is visible.

**Include a verb if a changeable label isn't clear enough.** For example, people might not know whether the changeable labels HDR On and HDR Off describe actions or states. If you needed to clarify that these items represent actions, you could add verbs to the labels, like Turn HDR On and Turn HDR Off.

**If necessary, display both menu items instead of one toggled item.** Sometimes, it helps people to view both actions or states at the same time. For example, a game could list both Take Account Online and Take Account Offline items, so when someone's account is online, only the Take Account Offline menu item appears available.

**Consider using a checkmark to show that an attribute is currently in effect.** It's easy for people to scan for checkmarks in a list of attributes to find the ones that are selected. For example, in the standard Format > Font menu, checkmarks can make it easy for people notice the styles that apply to selected text.

**Consider offering a menu item that makes it easy to remove multiple toggled attributes.** For example, if you let people apply several styles to selected text, it can work well to provide a menu item — such as Plain — that removes all applied formatting attributes at one time.

### In-game menus

In-game menus give players ways to control gameplay as well as determine settings for the game as a whole.

**Let players navigate in-game menus using the platform's default interaction method.** People expect to use the same interactions to navigate your menus as they use for navigating other menus on the device. For example, players expect to navigate your game menus using touch in iOS and iPadOS, and direct and indirect gestures in visionOS.

**Make sure your menus remain easy to open and read on all platforms you support.** Each platform defines specific sizes that work best for fonts and interaction targets. Sometimes, scaling your game content to display on a different screen — especially a mobile device screen — can make in-game menus too small for people to read or interact with. If this happens, modify the size of the tap targets and consider alternative ways to communicate the menu's content. For guidance, see Typography and Touch controls.

## Platform considerations

No additional considerations for macOS, tvOS, or watchOS.

### iOS, iPadOS

In iOS and iPadOS, a menu can display items in one of the following three layouts:

- **Small.** A row of four items appears at the top of the menu, above a list that contains the remaining items. For each item in the top row, the menu displays a symbol or icon, but no label.
- **Medium.** A row of three items appears at the top of the menu, above a list that contains the remaining items. For each item in the top row, the menu displays a symbol or icon above a short label.
- **Large (the default).** The menu displays all items in a list.

For developer guidance, see `preferredElementSize`.

**Choose a small or medium menu layout when it can help streamline people's choices.** Consider using the medium layout if your app has three important actions that people often want to perform. For example, Notes uses the medium layout to give people a quick way to perform the Scan, Lock, and Pin actions. Use the small layout only for closely related actions that typically appear as a group, such as Bold, Italic, Underline, and Strikethrough. For each action, use a recognizable symbol that helps people identify the action without a label.

### visionOS

In visionOS, a menu can display items using the small or large layout styles that iOS and iPadOS define (for guidance, see iOS, iPadOS). You can present a menu in your app or game from 3D content using a SwiftUI view. To ensure that your menu is always visible to people, even when other content occludes it, you can apply a breakthrough effect. As in macOS, an open menu in a visionOS window can appear outside of the window's boundaries.

**Prefer displaying a menu near the content it controls.** Because people need to look at a menu item before tapping it, they might miss the item's effect if the content it controls is too far away.

**Prefer the subtle breakthrough effect in most cases.** This effect blends the presentation with its surrounding content, to maintain legibility and usability while preserving the depth and context of the scene. When you select automatic for the breakthrough effect of a menu that overlaps with 3D content, the system applies subtle by default. You can use prominent if it's important to display a menu prominently over the entire scene in your app or game, but this can disrupt the experience for people and potentially cause discomfort. Alternatively, you can use none to fully occlude your menu behind other 3D content — for example, in a puzzle game that requires people to navigate around barriers — but this may make it difficult for people to see and access the menu.

## Web translation *(derived — not from Apple)*

Apple's HIG contains no web guidance. The mappings below apply the same principles to the web; they are inference, not Apple policy.

**A menu is not a listbox, and the web's ARIA taxonomy forces you to pick correctly.** Apple's menu items "represent a command, option, or state that affects the current selection or context" — that's a description of the ARIA `menu`/`menuitem` role family (with `menuitemcheckbox` and `menuitemradio` for toggled items), which is built for action-triggering, keyboard-navigable command lists that close on selection. It is easy to reach for a plain `<ul>` of buttons or a native `<select>` instead. A `<select>` is the right target only when the options are a flat set of mutually exclusive *values* to choose from — that's closer to Apple's pop-up button than to a general menu. Picking the wrong ARIA role means screen reader users get the wrong interaction model (arrow keys, Home/End, and Escape all behave differently between `menu`, `listbox`, and a generic list), so the mapping has to happen before markup, not after.

**Title-style capitalization and verb-first labels → carries over as a content convention, not a technical one.** There's no web-platform mechanism at stake here; it's a copy discipline. The reasoning is the same on any platform: a scanned, verb-led label ("Export…", "Duplicate") is faster to parse than a noun phrase, and this transfers unchanged to web menu, dropdown, and command-palette labels.

**The ellipsis convention → keep it, but don't rely on it as the only signal.** The "…" meaning "needs more input" is a shared desktop-OS convention web users already recognize, so reusing it in labels is safe. But screen readers don't reliably vocalize the character distinctly from a period, so treat it as a sighted-user hint layered on top of — not a substitute for — a genuinely clear label ("Export as PDF…" already says what's coming even without the punctuation).

**Separators for grouping → `role="separator"` inside a menu, or just structural grouping.** Apple's horizontal-line-or-gap separator between logical groups maps directly to ARIA's `separator` role nested inside a `menu`, or to wrapping each group in its own labelled region if the framework you're using doesn't expose raw ARIA roles.

**Dimmed-but-present unavailable items → `aria-disabled`, not `disabled`, inside a menu.** Apple's rule that an unavailable item must stay visible and reachable (dimmed, not removed) so people "can open it and learn about the commands it contains" argues specifically for `aria-disabled="true"` rather than the native `disabled` attribute on menu items — `disabled` pulls the element out of the tab order and off screen readers' radar entirely on many implementations, which defeats the discoverability Apple is protecting. `aria-disabled` keeps the item focusable and announced as unavailable while blocking activation.

**Submenu depth limits → the same instinct, stronger on the web.** Apple caps submenus at one level because deep hierarchical reveal is hard to navigate even with a pointer, eyes, or a remote. On the web, multi-level flyout submenus are additionally a known mobile/touch failure mode — hover-triggered flyouts have no touch equivalent, and nested keyboard traversal through more than one level is where most custom menu implementations break down. Treat one level as a hard ceiling, not a soft preference, on the web.

**No web analogue for controller/remote or gaze-based in-game menu navigation.** Apple's "let players navigate using the platform's default interaction method" spans touch, indirect gestures, and remotes, none of which have a settled web-platform equivalent; a browser-based game reimplementing this has to build its own input abstraction from scratch, and the only transferable principle is Apple's underlying one: don't force a single input paradigm onto every device the experience runs on.

## Do / Don't

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Label items with a verb or verb phrase in title-style capitalization | Include articles (a, an, the) in menu-item labels |
| Keep an unavailable menu open and its items visible but dimmed | Remove or hide unavailable items from a menu that still has available ones |
| Group logically related commands and separate groups with a separator | Split Paste and Paste and Match Style into different groups |
| Use a submenu when a term repeats across more than two items in a group | Nest submenus more than one level deep |
| Use a changeable, stateful label for a togglable attribute | List two permanently visible items for a simple on/off toggle when one will do |
| Provide icons for every item in a group, or none | Mix iconed and non-iconed items within the same group |
| Use the small iOS/iPadOS menu layout only for closely related grouped actions | Use the small layout for a set of unrelated top-level actions |
